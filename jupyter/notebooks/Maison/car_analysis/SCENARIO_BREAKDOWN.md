## Key Comparisons

### Upfront Cost Difference (V2H vs No V2H):
- **$7,000 difference**
- This is ONLY the charger difference ($7,900 V2H vs $900 standard)
- Both scenarios include the same $54,995 car and ~$150 net solar cost

### Why Both Include Solar:
Based on your requirements:
- You specified wanting to see solar benefits for EV/PHEV options
- Solar provides ~$1,000/year in energy savings
- Net solar cost after rebates is only ~$150
- Makes economic sense for any EV/PHEV purchase

### Annual Operating Difference (V2H vs No V2H):
- **$87/year** (V2H saves this much in rate arbitrage)
- NOT significant for economic payback
- V2H payback = $7,000 / $87 = 80+ years
- **Real V2H value = backup power**, not savings

### 10-Year Total Cost Comparison:
1. **Keep Prius V**: ~$35,200 (hard to beat!)
2. **ID.4 with Solar only**: ~$69,375
3. **ID.4 with V2H + Solar**: ~$75,505
4. **Plugin Hybrid + Solar**: ~$69,300
5. **Gasoline SUV**: ~$86,100

## Bottom Line

**ID.4 WITHOUT V2H = ID.4 WITH SOLAR (no backup power)**
- Still gets full solar benefits
- Standard Level 2 charger (7-9 hours for full charge)
- $7,000 cheaper than V2H option
- Same vehicle, same solar, different charger

**ID.4 WITH V2H = Full Setup with Backup Power**
- Premium feature for resilience, not economics
- 25-60 hours of backup power per month
- Small rate arbitrage benefit (~$87/year)
- $7,000 premium justified by backup power value

**If you want solar with EV but don't need backup power:**
→ Choose "ID.4 with Solar only" and save $7,000

**If backup power is important to you:**
→ V2H premium may be worth it for peace of mind
